*ivRmectin* enables users to simulate models of malaria transmission
with an explicit focus on exploring the impact of different
endectocide-based interventions such as ivermectin. This model has been
previously published and more information can be found in *Slater et
al., 2014, Journal of Infectious Diseases*
(<https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/210/12/1972/2908666>) and *Slater
et al., 2020, Lancet Infectious Diseases*
(<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30633-4/fulltext>).

## IMPORTANT NOTES

finished. Users outside Imperial College looking to run models in this
repository should contact one of the package authors first to discuss

*ivRmectin* enables users to simulate models of malaria transmission with an explicit focus on exploring the impact of different endectocide-based interventions such as ivermectin. This builds on previous work by Joel Hellewell, OJ Watson, Hannah Slater, Juliette Unwin, Rich Fitzjohn and Hannah Slater who developed a deterministic version of the Imperial College Malaria Model (first presented in *Griffin et al., 2010 PLOS Medicine*: https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000324). 

Subsequent work led by Hannah Slater and the rest of the team extended this model to model the impact of endectocides such as ivermectin on malaria epidemiology in endemic settings. This model has been previously published and more
information can be found in *Slater et al., 2014, Journal of Infectious Diseases* (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/210/12/1972/2908666) and *Slater et al., 2020, Lancet Infectious Diseases* (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30633-4/fulltext). 

## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This code is released with no support and currently is neither finished or complete. It is *NOT* ready for users outside Imperial College to run models. If you are interested in using this code,you *MUST* contact one of the package authors first to discuss requirements. 

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter names and behaviours, as well as output file formats, will change without notice.
